# OpenTrack – Project Scope

## 1. Problem Statement

Student developers preparing for global programs such as Google Summer of Code (GSoC), internships, and research opportunities struggle to manage applications, track open-source contributions, and monitor personal growth in a single system.

Most students rely on scattered tools like Notion, Excel sheets, bookmarks, and GitHub stars, which leads to poor visibility, lack of consistency, and inefficient preparation.

OpenTrack aims to solve this by providing a unified engineering dashboard for student developers.
