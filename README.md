# OpenTrack  
**Engineering Progress & Application Tracker for Developers**

OpenTrack is a full-stack web platform designed to help engineering students systematically track their technical growth, internship applications, and open-source journey.

It acts as a personal operating system for developers preparing for programs like **GSoC, internships, hackathons, and tech roles**.

---

## Why OpenTrack?

Most students manage progress using:
- scattered notes  
- spreadsheets  
- bookmarks  
- GitHub stars  

OpenTrack centralizes everything into a **single engineering dashboard**.

---

## Core Modules (Current)

### 1. Authentication System  
- User registration  
- User login  
- MongoDB-based user storage  
- Modular backend architecture  

### 2. Program Tracker  
- Add programs (GSoC, internships, fellowships)  
- Track status (Applied / In Progress / Selected)  

### 3. Engineering Roadmap  
- Personal learning tasks  
- DSA tracking  
- Progress visualization  

---

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React  
- TypeScript  
- Vite  

**Backend**
- Node.js  
- Express  
- MVC-style structure  

**Database**
- MongoDB (Mongoose)  

**Version Control**
- Git & GitHub (feature-based commits)

---

## Backend Architecture

server/
 ├── routes/        → API routes
 ├── controllers/   → Business logic
 ├── models/        → MongoDB schemas
 ├── index.js       → App entry point
 
---

This follows real-world **industry backend structure**.

---

## Current Project Status

**Phase:** Core System Development  

Completed:
- Backend project structure  
- MongoDB connection  
- User authentication APIs  
- Modular route-controller-model flow  

In progress:
- Frontend dashboard UI  
- Program management APIs  

---

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 – Core Platform  
- Authentication system  
- Basic dashboard UI  
- Program tracker  

### Phase 2 – Productivity  
- Learning roadmap  
- Notes system  
- Interview tracker  

### Phase 3 – Integrations  
- GitHub API  
- Contribution analytics  
- Public developer profiles  

---

## Vision

OpenTrack is built to become a **long-term personal engineering companion** —  
not just a college project.

The goal is to help developers:
- stay consistent  
- track real progress  
- build disciplined engineering habits  
- prepare systematically for global tech opportunities
